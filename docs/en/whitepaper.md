##Introduction and warning
Bitlle Network is a project created by the fans of blockchain technologies. We believe Bitcoin is digital gold, we believe Ethereum is the best platform for decentralized organizations and apps. We also believe that in the very near future the world is going to change drastically because of these technologies.

We will conduct token sales during the development and testing phases, whose main goal will be to circulate our tokens as widely as possible, and distribute them primarily to the people who really believe in our project. 

**Token listing on an exchange is not one of the project’s priorities.** The current price of new token listing on even the less popular exchanges is absolutely inadequate. We’d rather use these funds (our investors’ money) to develop the project, so that the exchanges would later seek to list our token themselves. Thus, if you’re not particularly interested in our project, but are planning to quickly sell our token with minimal profit immediately after listing, it would be expedient to choose another project.

However, if after reading this WhitePaper you believe in us, in our ideas and technologies, we’d be very happy to see you join our community!

##1. Summary
Every day millions of consumers take part in various merchants’ (stores’, services’) loyalty programs and receive bonuses for their participation. However, these programs do not allow them to freely exchange different companies’ bonuses among themselves. That’s why the majority of bonuses remain unclaimed, leading to the loss of interest in such programs on the part of the consumers.

We are imagining and creating a future where people would be able to freely exchange their loyalty bonuses.

We are establishing the **Bitlle Network** - a decentralized solution that anyone can use to make purchases in one store/service, receive corresponding bonuses and exchange them for the ones that they need at the time.

![](https://bitlle.network/wiki/images/wp_exchange.png) 
 
The free bonus conversion capability is not only the next logical stage in the development of the global loyalty market, it is, in fact, a revolution that determines new, transparent and honest rules of the game.

We’re developing a product that will allow to create revolutionary loyalty programs based on the free exchange concept - they will be quickly rolled out or easily integrated into already existing programs.

We are offering business an affordable integrated solution for the quick launch of bonus programs in very different business sectors. The project is founded on blockchain technologies, but only where it’s truly necessary: for bonus-related transactions between network participants. We are not trying to force traditional businesses to switch their loyalty programs entirely to a decentralized basis. This makes our product flexible and independent of a number of disadvantages of the blockchain technology.

Bitlle Network will be lucrative and useful to all of the market participants.:

* Consumers will be able to exchange bonuses freely and quickly, as well as give them as gifts to friends and family. Secondary markets may subsequently emerge, where consumers will be able to legally sell their bonuses.
* Business will obtain an easily implemented efficient loyalty instrument that does not require additional expenditures or a switch over to a new technological track. If there’s a loyalty system already in place, it will be easily integrated with the Bitlle Network.
* Ether (ETH) holders will be able to earn by conducting Bitlle network members’ transactions and exchange operations on the Ethereum blockchain.
 
##2. Why “customer loyalty”?
There is a multitude of blockchain projects that claim to resolve problems in different spheres of life. However, the real number of functioning products that utilize this revolutionary technology still remains insignificant in the stream of projects that are still unimplemented, but have already made bold declarations.

The word ‘blockchain’ has become a marketing idol, a magnet for investments in something mysterious, yet, like a genie, capable to resolve any existing issue in any business segment.

The customer loyalty industry is precisely the sphere where blockchain technology may be applied to the fullest extent, utilizing all of the opportunities it provides, and where it would be able to bring in real assistance and profit, rather than merely being a poster ad that promises redemption from all problems.

A token, which is essentially a monetary unit, is the foundation of the majority of blockchain projects. Their creators want to modernize the existing monetary system, provide competition to fiat currencies, which is logical and correct, but will probably take a long time, since the state is unlikely to want to part with the monopoly for currency issuance. That’s why any attempts to bring new payment units into circulation face tough limitations and prohibitions on the part of the regulators. 

Loyalty bonuses are also ‘money’ in a sense, with their own price, and may be exchanged for real goods (services). However, unlike tokens, they are not attracting as much attention on the part of the regulators. Thus, it is logical for the integration of blockchain technology to occur much sooner in this segment. And if we consider the colossal volumes and the potential of the client loyalty market, we can obtain vast experience, which can be subsequently applied to a wide range of other, more complex spheres of business and life.

##3. Survey of the customer loyalty market
The international retail market has been demonstrating steady growth in the last few years, and while in 2016 its volume amounted to $22.05 trillion, experts estimate the 2018 figure to be at the $24.86 trillion level, and by 2020 it should reach the $27.73 trillion mark<sup>([Statista. Total retail sales worldwide 2015-2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/443522/global-retail-sales/))</sup>. It’s only logical that the client loyalty market is linked closely to these numbers. Its actual volume is more difficult to estimate, since merchants use a very wide range of instruments in order to increase loyalty. Some experts estimate its volume to reach $6.995 billion, however, this is a very modest number that evaluates mostly major merchants that use expensive platforms to manage client loyalty. If we presume that by 2020 at least 30% of the entire international retail turnover ($27.73 trillion) accounts for merchants that use client loyalty programs, then, presuming that they will spend at least 0.5% of their turnover on loyalty, the potential volume of the client loyalty market will amount to $41.59 billion. And it will grow year-to-year, with the small and medium business acting as the main drivers of such growth<sup>([Allied Market Research. Loyalty management market 2016-2023](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/press-release/loyalty-management-market.html))</sup>.
![](https://bitlle.network/wiki/images/w_customer_market.png)

However, there’s a flip side to this growth - the competition is growing, and increasingly greater investments are required on the part of business in the struggle for client loyalty. Meanwhile, market research reveals that the average efficiency of loyalty programs is decreasing year to year. The clients are growing more demanding, and standard bonus offers no longer offer enough motivation.

1. Awarded bonuses are rarely needed at the time immediately following the purchase (or possibly ever), so they either burn up by the time of the next purchase, or they are not even remembered (periodic reminders don’t always help either).

    <big>43% of all consumers state that bonuses burn up before they can spend them, and 38% don’t even know whether they have available bonuses in their accounts</big><sup>([CodeBroker.Retail executive report: Shopper loyalty survey results](https://codebroker.com/resources2/doc/CodeBroker%20Loyalty%20Survey%20Results.pdf))</sup>.

2. People in major cities are surrounded by a large number of uniform bonus offers, that’s why the value of each distinct offer is undermined in the eyes of a potential buyer.
    
    <big>Up to 90% of consumers have a negative perception of loyalty programs</big><sup>([Capgemini. Loyalty Deciphered: How Emotions Drive Genuine Engagement](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dti_loyalty-deciphered_29nov17_final.pdf))</sup>.

3. For offline stores, either a separate plastic card or a bonus app is required for each loyalty program. The more of them you have in your wallet/smartphone, the less consumers want to join each subsequent program.

    <big>43% of consumers believe that the presence of the required plastic card is the greatest barrier to accumulating bonuses while shopping, and 17% are annoyed by the need to look for the right card when it is required</big><sup>([CodeBroker.Retail executive report: Shopper loyalty survey results](https://codebroker.com/resources2/doc/CodeBroker%20Loyalty%20Survey%20Results.pdf))</sup>. 

4. Very few merchants have truly modern loyalty program interfaces; as a rule they are either standard inconvenient apps, or even more inconvenient plastic cards, which allow to find out your bonus balance at the register (sometimes it’s even possible to see it on the merchant’s website using the card number).
    
    <big>Only 30% of participants are satisfied with their experience of interacting with loyalty program websites</big><sup>([Customer Relationship Management Academy of Asia](https://www.crmasia.org/resource/ailing-loyalty-rewards-programs-today/))</sup>.
    
    <big>Out of the brands that haven’t launched a mobile version of their loyalty program, 81% have indicated the lack of technical resources and support as the main barrier to its implementation</big><sup>([3Cinteractive. Mobile Loyalty Report 2017](https://www.3cinteractive.com/resources/mobile-loyalty-report-2017/))</sup>.

All of the above makes participation in loyalty programs less tempting, thus, they are having an ever smaller influence on the motivation to choose a specific merchant. It’s increasingly more difficult for merchants to stand out among the rest with their programs, and it’s becoming increasingly harder to convince new clients to add another card to their wallet or install yet another mobile app.

These problems are the consequence of a natural limitation - the absence of a technological base for different merchants to award universal bonuses, which clients could handle with one interface (app), and which they could exchange with clients of other stores and services. In fact, this limitation could not be overcome at all in the past, since there was no independent and trusted solution to structure this process upon. However, today, with the onset of the distributed technology era, the only question is who will be the first to use them in their client loyalty management strategy.

##4. Bitlle Network


###The future of loyalty

There’s a statement in the traditional approach to customer loyalty, which claims that burnt-up bonuses are an additional profit for their issuer. There’s even a concept of breakage, which shows the share of burnt-up bonuses. However, modern practice and research reveals that the higher the breakage is in competitive markets, the lower the retention rate (client retention coefficient) in the long-term<sup>[David Feldman. Loyalty myths: Is breakage good?](https://medium.com/@dfcatch/loyalty-myths-is-breakage-good-873950da26dc)</sup>. This means that clients come back less frequently to stores where lots of their bonuses burn up.

So, what can be done if people don’t want to use the bonuses here and now, while the attempts to force it on lead to losing the client? It’s crucial for the spending of bonuses to generate new sales, but does it have to be done by the same person who received them initially? The answer is simple - provide a chance to transfer bonus points to people who really need them, who will go to the merchant and make a purchase.

The chief argument of the supporters of private loyalty programs is that the chance to transfer bonuses to third parties will give rise to ‘gray’ market participants, who will buy up discounted loyalty bonuses en masse, or exchange them for expensive goods, which is not profitable for the merchant. However, the program founder has a potent antidote - if the bonuses are bought up, it creates demand, where they can be sold alongside regular clients’ bonuses. The process will resemble standard gift card sales. Therefore, the merchant, as the exclusive issuer of their bonuses and operating under market laws, can regulate the loyalty economy to their advantage, granting freedom to the clients.

The most important thing is that there is no question of whether the business needs this new type of loyalty. The creators of bitcoin had not asked banks or states whether they need this type of currency. They knew that the banks and the states, on the contrary, do not are not all in favor of the emergence of a similar instrument. However, people have accepted Bitcoin, and now the regulators and various financial organizations are forced to take it into account. The story is the same with freely convertible bonuses - we definitely know that people need this. And while some of the merchants (especially major ones) are in doubt, young companies with a new vision will appear, ready for any experiments in their struggle for clients. When the new client loyalty paradigm is accepted by both regular people and daring, innovative business, major players will be forced to take it into account, otherwise they’d risk losing.

###Infrastructure

In our research we’ve studied several versions of the technological structure of the Bitlle Network: a) existing blockchain that allows to work with custom tokens (created by users) without using a parent token; b) proprietary blockchain with the logic and rules we require; c) off-chain solution over trusted blockchain.

We’ve rejected the first option almost immediately, since all blockchains that allow to select the transaction commission payment method are structured upon DPOS consensus and its varieties, which is a dead end - we would have needed to spend a fair amount of time on controlling the ‘selections’ in order to protect the interests of the Bitlle Network instead of using it to improve our proprietary technologies.

These are precisely the reasons why we’ve rejected the idea of building a proprietary blockchain. With all of its disadvantages, proof-of-work is currently the most stable and the only consensus that has proven its viability in large networks, however, at the initial stages, the network built upon it is vulnerable to attacks. New PoWs aren’t attacked only because there’s no value there, and an attack is expensive. Our network, on the other hand, will immediately start moving assets, which have a nominal value that the merchants accept them at, which means that we can not take this risk. The creation of a maximally decentralized network with a reliable consensus is a very difficult task that may require a lot of resources, thus, there won’t be enough for the primary business logic.

The most appropriate way is to create a structure over a strong and already functional blockchain project with an extensive development community that keeps track of network stability, thus freeing us from this task and allowing our team to focus on technologies that specifically target the client loyalty market. We’ve selected Ethereum, it’s the most promising and reliable decentralized environment of all the existing ones.

One of the most promising vectors in Ethereum off-chain scalability is the payment channel technology, which projects like Plasma, Raiden and Liquidity Network are working on. A stable environment may be based on it in the future, an environment where a huge number of cheap transactions will be conducted. However, in the paradigm where this technology exists today, it is entirely unsuitable for loyalty bonus transactions. Without going into details, payment channels require all the participants to conduct very specific work on sustaining them, which goes way beyond the habitual ‘client-merchant’ interaction.

This is why we’ve agreed on a more practical approach. We create off-chain solutions with their own interaction protocol (smart contract-based), owing to which the main users (store and service customers) will no longer require ETH to send loyalty tokens. Meanwhile, tokens are immediately recorded in the Ethereum blockchain (unlike the process in payment channels) by a decentralized network of independent Bitlle Network nodes, transaction price is decreased because of special market instruments, and the speed of block formation in Ethereum does not have any influence over the awarding/debiting of bonuses by the manufacturer.

Bitlle Network infrastructure may be provisionally subdivided into three parts (layers):

![](https://bitlle.network/wiki/images/w_bn_infrastructure.png)

On the bottom is the Ethereum blockchain - a distributed ledger that guarantees the non-reversibility of all transactions and proper balance recording. 

The middle layer is the Bitlle Network itself - the interaction protocol for all network participants and smart contract structure that ensures its fulfillment. Its main tasks are: a) provide an opportunity to network members (merchants and their clients) to conduct Loyalty Tokens (LT) transactions without paying for gas in ETH; b) provide a technology that guarantees secure LT exchange among the participants.

The top layer is the Bitlle Platform - instruments and interfaces for the business to work with the Bitlle Network. Meanwhile, the platform can function independently of the network, since the Bitlle Network is used only in those business processes where it’s really needed - in the transactions and LT exchange between network members,

Thus, we are creating an optimal and non-redundant scheme, where each layer plays its proper role.

###How it works

####Merchant

In order to launch a loyalty program on the Bitlle Network, a merchant would need to either install a plugin to his CMS/CRM in a couple of clicks, or instal a special script on his server. The option of using cloud service will be implemented for the most undemanding ones. After a quick tune-up of all the loyalty program parameters, launch of their Loyalty Token (LT), as well as the customization and branding of a mobile bonus app (using an intuitive constructor), the merchant would be able to distribute his mobile app to the clients and award bonuses to them.This entire set of instruments is what constitutes the Bitlle Network.

If a merchant already has a loyalty system in place with a proprietary bonus app, he would be able to integrate it with the Bitlle Network via API.

####Client 

Installs the mobile app and starts to receive bonuses for purchases. The bonuses are initially stored in the merchant’s local database (or cloud), but at the client’s wish he can move the funds to his account on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as move the clients’ bonuses to the blockchain with their permission, for instance, when a certain amount has accrued, thus gaining even greater loyalty.

The client does not need to install the app of every store that’s linked to the web. With the assistance of any branded and customized app it would be possible to manage any bonuses within the network. Besides, the client can install the default Bitlle Network with the same full set of features.

####Aggregators

These are the independent Bitlle Network nodes that ensure the network’s functioning by conducting all of its users’ transactions. They receive a commission in Bitlle Tokens (BTL) or Loyalty Tokens (LT) that aggregators agree to accept.

A simplified LT transaction scheme involving network members looks as follows:

![](https://bitlle.network/wiki/images/w_bn_aggregators.png)

####Vendors and validation

Any merchant in any spot on the planet will be able to link up to the Bitlle Network independently. In order for regular users to be able to distinguish real merchant bonuses from fake ones, Loyalty Token smart contracts will go through validation. Such bonuses will have a ‘trusted’ status (a special badge in the mobile app).

During the first phase, the Bitlle Foundation will conduct validation itself, and subsequently this function will be transferred to Vendors - the network’s regional representatives who will:

* Engage and verify merchants in their region.
* Accept payment for network services in fiat and crypto (convert to BTL).
* Buy bonuses from the clients and aggregators for the purpose of subsequent resale.

####Other participants

The Bitlle Network’s logic and ideology stipulates the emergence of secondary markets, where very different participants interact. For instance, independent online services that allow to legally buy out and resell bonuses for fiat, or merchants who are ready to accept other (major and popular) merchants’ bonuses for their goods/services.

Besides, the entire code will be open at the time of the network launch, that’s why various independent developers will be able to structure their projects using Bitlle Network technologies.

###Bitlle Network architecture

####Interaction scheme

A more detailed scheme is provided below, with all the network members and the logic of their interactions delineated using 2 transactions as an example: 1) Merchant sends Loyalty Tokens (LT) to his client (Client 1) and pays the commission in BTL tokens (the entire transaction is designated by a solid arrow →); 2) Client 2 sends LT to Client 1 and also pays commission in LT (the entire transaction is designated by a dashed arrow ⇢).

![](https://bitlle.network/wiki/images/w_bn_schema.png)

####Smart contracts

A smart contract structure that allows to emit, store, transfer and securely exchange Loyalty Tokens (LT) is at the core of the entire system. Smart contracts are located in the Ethereum blockchain, which guarantees maximal security and fail-safety.

####Internal messages

In order to enable users to send commands to smart contracts (for transfers, exchange and withdrawal) an internal messaging system has been developed. The messages are formed and signed by the user with his private key and are recognized by the smart contract. Anyone who has installed the Aggregator’s software can deliver such a message to the Ethereum network and receive a corresponding reward in LT in the amount negotiated with the sender.

A client’s method cannot be compromised, as it is guaranteed technologically: every message is signed with an ECDSA digital signature, and the validity of each signature is verified directly in the smart contract prior to conducting a transaction. Messages are structured similarly to Ethereum messages, they are encapsulated in the parent network messages.

Message structure sample:

```
struct LTmsg
{
   address token;
   address to;
   uint256 value;
   uint256 fee;
   uint256 nonce;
   bytes sig;
}
```

where: 

**token** - address of the LT-token being sent

**to** - receiver address

**value** - amount of transfer

**fee** - commission to be received by the aggregator

**nonce** - the message’s consecutive number (required for compliance with the order of commands and for protection from repeated use of the signed message) .

**sig** - digital signature defined as: ```sig = sign(privateKey.keccak256(token,to,value,fee,nonce));, где sign(bytes32 provateKey,bytes32 hashMsg)``` - a function that accepts the private key and message field hash as arguments, and returns a signature 

A primitive demonstration of token transfer with commission payments in the same tokens is implemented at [demo.bitlle.network](https://demo.bitlle.network), where the set of features is built in a manner described above and launched in the Ethereum Ropsten test network.

####Loyalty Token (LT)

Bitlle Platform provides every merchant with an opportunity to issue proprietary bonuses as standard ERC20 tokens, which are already supported by Ethereum wallets and exchanges. This gives the users a chance to exchange bonuses not only within Bitlle Network, but also at any other service or exchange.

####Aggregation 

Aggregators will guarantee all network transactions by accepting messages in Bitlle Network format and sending them to the Ethereum network. Specialized cross-platform software with support of the Bitlle Network protocol will be created for them to work with. Aggregators will be able to select the LT tokens they are willing to work with (accept for exchange and as transaction commission payment), as well as to set their exchange rates. Aggregators will receive their awards after delivering the message to the smart contract.

####Cost optimization

Besides the batch dispatch of transactions to Ethereum to save on gas, the aggregators will have a chance to to occupy memory segments at points in time when gas is cheap and use it when its price grows. [GasToken](https://gastoken.io/) functions according to the same principle:

```
function free_storage(uint256 value)
{
    uint256 supply;    
	uint256 feed_location = 0xfeed;
	assembly { supply := sload(feed_location) }   	 
	uint256 f = feed_location + supply - value + 1;
	uint256 t = feed_location + supply;
	for (uint256 i = f; i <= t; i++)
	{
           assembly { sstore(i, 0) }
	}    
	assembly { sstore(feed_location, sub(supply, value)) }
}
```

####Client app

Loyalty program member interacts with the Bitlle Network via a mobile app (default or merchant-branded). A client can use it to see their bonuses both in the merchant’s local database and in the blockchain. If a client joins another merchant’s loyalty program, those bonuses will be displayed in the app as well, so there’s no need to install another app. The client will be able to send their bonuses to other network members or exchange them through the app, 

We understand that as advanced as a merchant’s audience may be, there’ll always be clients who don’t need any of these options. That’s why a client can refuse to transfer their bonuses to blockchain by adjusting the settings in the client app, in which case they will just be stored in the local database (or in the cloud) of the Bitlle Platform.

####Merchant interface (Bitlle Platform)

After installing specialized platform software (or while using cloud solutions), the merchant needs to create their LT-token contract and publish it in the Ethereum network. For that purpose they would need to use simple loyalty program settings and the contract will be automatically generated and published in the network.

If the merchant wants to brand his loyalty app, they can use a special constructor.

The bonuses are initially awarded locally and recorded in the database on the merchant side (Bitlle Platform). There are three subsequent options: 1) after each purchase  the merchant automatically awards bonuses to Ethereum addresses of the clients who’ve requested it; 2) merchant does it with a pre-set periodicity, or when a specific amount of bonuses is accrued; 3) the client initiates the withdrawal of bonuses to blockchain at their discretion. Such a flexible approach guarantees the chance of working with a wide audience.

###Bitlle Тoken (BTL)

####Function

BTL is the Bitlle Network ERC20 parent token [contract address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x92685e93956537c25bb75d5d47fca4266dd628b8) with emission limited to 100 000 000 BTL. It is required in the network for the following purposes:

* Creation and publication of the LT-token contract.
* Stake for working as an aggregator (the larger the stake, the more lucrative the work).

Besides, it can be used for the following tasks:

* Payment for any transaction commissions. BTL is the network’s most liquid token, which will always be accepted by aggregators. That’s why when sending less liquid LT-tokens, it will be always more profitable to pay transaction commissions in BTL. Besides, if an LT is not quite liquid, then there may not be a single aggregator that will accept it as commission, in which case the transaction may be executed only through using BTL.
* Universal loyalty token. If a client does not need any bonuses, he may be interested in exchanging the bonuses in his possession for BTL. Bonuses have a fixed price at the merchants’, while BTL has growth potential, that’s why the client would be able to exchange them for a greater number of bonuses in the future.

####BTLX

BTLX is the provisional designation of the future, more functional version of the BTL token. When the new token is released, it will be available in exchange for the old ones via a specialized conversion smart contract at a 1:1 exchange rate. In the course of the exchange, the old BTL tokens will be burnt up, and the exact same number of new ones will be issued. Thus the sum total of old and new tokens will never exceed 100 000 000 tokens. If the user is content with the existing BTL features (for instance, they use BTL exclusively as a deposit for working as an aggregator), he is not required to exchange the tokens.

Why is it needed? It was impossible to foresee all the conditions and peculiarities of the architecture being developed in the existing BTL smart contract, since they require time and funds to develop and test. Thus, an ERC20 token that corresponds to the current needs of the system was issued for the period of system development.

####BTL token distribution

The following table presents the general scheme of Bitlle Token distribution:

| Distribution stages and goals         | The number of distributed BTL | Details |
|:-------------                         |:-----------------------------:|:-------------|
| Project founders, team and advisors   | 30 000 000.00                 | This number also includes the foundation to engage experts and partners in the future. Since the launch of  “Big Tokensale”, the tokens of the team’s active members are locked in special smart contracts until the main development phases are completed. |
| Bounty Fund                           | 4 000 000.00                  | Tokens allotted for rewarding the network's most loyal users. Includes tokens provided for allocation by Bitlle Cashback and other partner services. |
| Token Sales                           | 46 000 000,00                 | Including pre-sale between August 25, 2018 and November 25, 2018 (regulated by the following documents: [BTL Token Sale Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FJ7_0YDVvFbyoefkF1vF1858p_T7QqnCP9U8qOP3Irk/edit) и [General Terms & Conditions of BTL Token Sale](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bGfWK2UGd7GJF-6KlzicFsfS2l6zISroqLI1-E4vlrw/edit) ) and all next token sales (“Big Tokensale”). |
| <nobr>Subsidized fund</nobr>          | 20 000 000.00                 | A fund to be used for primary aggregator rewards. During the first stages of network evolution it will be used to subsidize the gas used by aggregators. |
| **Total**                             | <nobr>100 000 000.00</nobr>   |  |

###Business model and promotion strategy

Despite the fact that our product is created primarily for people (loyalty program users), we understand that we need to ‘sell’ our solution to the merchants, convince them that there’s no loss in it for them, while the return can be significant. That’s why the basic version of the Bitlle Platform, comprising a customizable app and a server component, will be distributed practically free of charge (a merchant will only need to pay for publishing his token contract on Ethereum - an amount no greater than $1). There are no other offers of similar quality on the market. From our experience in the loyalty program sphere we know that there will be a vast number of entrepreneurs who want to offer their clients a proprietary branded app with proprietary, rather than coalition bonuses. We will not require merchants to move their bonuses to blockchain, but our system will be structured in a way that would allow the clients to withdraw their bonuses to Ethereum at their discretion, with no interference on the part of the merchant.

Businesses will receive a practically free solution from us, while creating a market for us in return. The more of such merchants there are, the more members will the Bitlle network comprise, which means more transactions, and more aggregators to process them. All of the above will increase the demand for the BTL token, which is what our business model aims to do.

In the future, we see the possibility of using an agent-centered paradigm, where local operators distribute the Bitlle Platform via a freemium model, earning on the sales of the more advanced versions of the platform.

###Bitlle Cashback pilot project

Bitlle Cashback is the project that we used to study the possibilities of implementing decentralized technologies in the loyalty industry. Aside from its immediate function (that of a cashback service), it is also one of the BTL token primary distribution instruments. It is also the first service that will be linked up to the Bitlle network.

Its mode of operation is rather simple. A Bitlle Cashback user makes a purchase in one of the stores linked to the service, for which the store pays an affiliate commision in fiat, which is funneled to project development. Users receive BTL tokens for their activity (purchases).

![](https://bitlle.network/wiki/images/w_bn_pilot.png)

In the future this service will be integrated into the Bitlle Network mobile app, and users will not only be able to receive merchant bonuses, but BTL tokens for their purchases in the stores linked up to the cashback program. 2,000,000 BTL has been allocated for this project (part of Bounty Fund). When this quota is exhausted, the project will purchase BTL tokens in the open market, thus creating additional demand on the BTL market.

If a hard cap is reached during the tokensale, the project will undergo a transformation: any BTL token holder will be able to provide their cashback services instead of a centralized service. To do that, the user would need to register in the partner program of a store or a service, and then enter their referral information in the Bitlle Cashback affiliate profile. Clients who make their purchases through such partners will receive BTL from them at pre-set rates. Meanwhile, the partner will receive fiat rewards from the store/service.

##5. Review of competitors

**Qiibee.** The project that’s closest to ours in its logic. Promises the option for the merchants to issue their own loyalty tokens and branded bonus app for clients. However, the project economy stipulates that merchants are required to buy the parent QBX token to link up and issue bonuses, which raises the entrance barrier for merchants. The use of such DPOS-like blockchains is intended for storing and operating with bonuses with the possibility of withdrawing them to the main Ethereum network, however, there is no information as to who may guarantee the operations of these sidechains, how secure they would be, and what their entire point is.

**Bitrewards.** A coalition blockchain-based loyalty program, which allows stores to award cashbacks in BI tokens. There’s no option for merchants to issue their own bonuses. The project is slated to be based on Ethereum blockchain. The need to pay transaction commissions is supposed to be eliminated by the ‘payment channel’ technology developed by the third-party Raiden project, which is yet to announce its release date. It also remains unclear how exactly this technology will be used, since the payment channel logic requires very specific participation in its work on the part of all users. 

**Pluscoin and Nickelcoin.** Just like Bitrewards, these two projects offer merchants the opportunity to award cashbacks in coalition program tokens (PLC and NKL, accordingly). The project token is Ethereum-based. The issue of needing to pay for gas for their token transactions is either not being resolved, which limits the potential user audience, or the information on its resolution is absent from the whitepaper.

**Loyalcoin.** Promises to provide merchants an opportunity to issue their own loyalty tokens. However, the project is based on the NEM blockchain, rather than on Ethereum.

**Gatcoin.** Also plans to offer the merchants an opportunity to create their own blockchain-based bonuses. GAT is an Ethereum-based ERC20 token, but the technology is not in place yet, since the team is waiting for the implementation of one of third-party projects - RadixDLT, EOS or Waves.

There are other projects as well, but generally the market can be subdivided into two parts - 1) blockchain-based coalition programs, with a common token to award cashbacks; 2) platforms for issuing personal loyalty tokens.

Bitlle Network possesses the advantage of already having a real technology in the project, a technology that allows to establish loyalty programs over one of the most trusted and stable blockchains on the planet and does not require more than traditional programs do of its members. Meanwhile, we can partner with projects that are creating coalition programs, they won’t have to wait for third-party releases in order to fully realize its own. 

##6. Technical Roadmap

Since Bitlle Network and Bitlle Platform are essentially two independent products, in order to optimize the process, we are dividing the development into two parallel processes, which will coincide in certain points.

##7. Our contribution to the Ethereum-community

Despite the fact that several projects, which have emerged within last year, are positioning themselves as Ethereum’s competitors (and even as its ‘doom’), we’re convinced that Ethereum philosophy is the best and most promising in the long-term. Even though some projects are conducting a great number of transactions per second in the test mode, they already have a flawed and extremely centralized logic, which will surely manifest its weak side under real-life conditions.

We believe that the path the Ethereum community is following (sharding, Casper) will lead all of us to a sustainable and truly decentralized infrastructure with high throughput capacity.

We would lie to engage more people in crypto-economy via loyalty programs, people who would subsequently utilize Ethereum’s decentralized technologies in other spheres of their lives as well.

##9. Legal

Bitlle Network token (BTL) belongs to utility tokens. It serves for entrance to the System (for the aggregators to deposit funds for the purpose of providing transactional and exchange services to the loyalty program users).

BTL does not have a legal qualification of a security. BTL tokens do not entitle their holders to a share in the raised capital, dividends or any other income. Neither do they give voting rights which would allow to influence the project development, explicitly or implicitly.

Furthermore, we would like to clarify that once the System is launched no transaction fees or other payments will be collected. Thus there will be no revenue to distribute. All the funds raised will be allocated to the Bitlle Network development, launch, promotion, and related purposes.

##10. Risks

Since the project development depends on various factors (technical, economical, political, financial, legislative), the following risks may apply:

* security risks, e.g. theft of tokens, attacks on smart contract;
* cyber-threats (e.g. DDoS attacks);
* risks associated with Ethereum blockchain (any disruptions in Ethereum protocol);
* risk of legislative changes, prohibiting or restricting token-related operations in certain countries;
* risks associated with the new technologies (crypto tokens including BTL represent a new technology which can be labelled as unchecked so far);
* risk of government action and many others, internal or external, explicit or implicit.

##11. Disclaimer

The information provided in this White Paper does not impose any restrictions on our right to change, add or remove any part of it for any reason, at any time — before, during and after the sale of BTL tokens. If there is any inconsistency between a translation and the English version of this White Paper, the English version prevails.

Residents of the USA, the Republic of Korea, the People’s Republic of China or any other country where distribution or dissemination of Token Sale or Initial Coin Offering is prohibited or restricted should eschew acquiring BTL tokens. Should this happen, Bitlle Network will not bear any responsibility.

BTL tokens should not be perceived as an investment. This White Paper does not constitute any advice to sell or purchase BTL tokens or give any help in any investment decision.

Anyone acquiring BTL tokens acknowledges and confirms the following statements:

* They have made themselves acquainted with Terms of Service and Terms of Token Sale and realize all the possible risks;
* They purchase BTL in compliance with the regulation that is currently in force within their country;
* They will not use BTL tokens to carry out illicit activities, such as financing of terrorism and money-laundering;
